# Introduction

You should be able to do this in an hour or so. There's minimal 
soldering, but you do need to do a bit. You do need to be able to use 
node and have a server to put this on (if you know me, ask and you can 
borrow mine for a bit).

The steps are:

 Firstly, create a server.

 Secondly, get the pi part working and test.

 Thirdly, use the instructions below to customise it and make it look cool.

You will need:

 * access to a server that can run node, configurable to use https

Pi stuff
 * a [Pi 3 B plus](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-b-plus) (£34), [Micro SD card](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/noobs-32gb-microsd-card-3-1?variant=31703694245971) (8GB or more, £9), a power supply (ideally [an official Pi one](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply), £8)
 * [female-female jumper cable](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky-junior?variant=1076482185) (£3)
 * [a pan-tilt hat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pan-tilt-hat?variant=22408353287) (£34)
 * [a 5*5 led matrix](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/5x5-rgb-matrix-breakout) (£9)
 * [a pi camera](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module-v2-1-with-mount?variant=19833929735) (£24) (?longer cable?)
 * a USB A speaker Mic (£50-100) - These can be expensive because they are businessy, but they are much the best thing to use. [Sennheiser SP20](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-Speaker-Phone-Mobile-Devices/dp/B00K2RQ94C) is the best I've used, [Jabra 410 works](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jabra-SPEAK-Portable-speakerphone-7410-109/dp/B007SHJIO2/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=jabra+speaker+410&qid=1605168655&s=electronics&sr=1-2), though I've had power problems with my Jabra in the past. You don't need bluetooth (Bluetooth can be difficult on the Pi). Kaysuda and others do ones around £50 but I don't know if they are any good. It needs to be a speaker-mic (termed 'speakerphone') not a condensing mic which look similar. 

Decorations
 * a good pot to put it in. I used [a Sunpet ??00ml sweet jar like this one](http://www.alsafifalcongroup.com/images/sunpet-big-9.jpg) which i got from a our local hardware store for 89p. This [Systema jar would also be a good fit](https://sistemaplastics.com/products/klip-it-utility/900ml-cracker). Plastic is better than metal I think, on the grounds that unexpected shorts are more probable.
   * the important thing is that you can get the Pi 3 with the power supply and usb speaker connected into the top. Width??
 * some socks, I used [these](https://www.marksandspencer.com/modal-pima-cotton-fine-striped-socks/p/clp60287370?color=BLACKMIX#intid=prodColourId-60287368) but any stretchy shortish pair with a "cuff" (extra stratchy bit at the top") would work
 * googly eyes
 * some thin but rigid card and a craft knife or scissors
 * optional: some thin garden or other coated plastic wire, sewing thread, needle, and two tiny safety pins

Tools
 * SD card reader
 * something to make holes in plastic
 * a gluegun or uhu glue
 * a soldering iron (there's not much soldering - just for the led matrix)

The total is about £235 assuming you have tools. Maybe £50 less if you 
can find a cheaper USB mic / speaker.

# Making it look cool / cute


 * make a notch in the lid sufficently large that the camera ribbon cable and all the other wires will comfortably fit
 * put everything in there
 * screw the top on by moving the body of the jar (if it's a screw top)
 * glue or screw the pantilt mechanism to the top with the front 180 degrees from the notch
 * add the face to the head @@ and screw on the led matrix and the camera
 * clip the camera to the pan-tilt hat
 * take your pair of stretchy socks
 * use glue (e.g. uhu or similar, gluegun would also do) to make a hole in one sock near the heel, that doesn't run (this is for the power cable and usb cable)
 * thread the usb and power wires through the hole
 * pull the sock over the base and carefully over all the wires, fitting it around the face by folding it.
 * add some googly eyes
 * plug it in!
